###### Ongole.

 Perhaps even more famous than its beautiful beaches are the local cattle and oxen in Ongole, Andhra Pradesh. One of the major **Zebu breeds of cattle**, the Ongole cows and bulls from this region are exported regularly, and have gone as far as North America, South America, and Europe.

But there’s more than just cows for you to see here. A beautiful, **albeit small coastal town**, Ongole has a long and interesting religious and spiritual history, dating back to 230 BCE. There are temples and inscriptions all over town proving its existence in ancient times. The **Mauryas** and the **Satavahanas** were the most prominent rulers of the region, and many of the temples and monuments that they built, still stand tall as a testament to their greatness.

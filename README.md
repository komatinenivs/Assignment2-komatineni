###### India.

 **I am proud to be Indian** because of our country’s achievements in space and missile technology. India has launched a number of satellites in space for helping us in weather forecast, communications, medical research, and education. The missiles such as **Agni, Prithvi strengthened our nation’s security and ensured a place in the elite group of the world’s powerful countries**. Moreover, our scientists have lifted India’s pride by placing our Tri-colour on the moon and are now looking for landing in the planet Mars.
